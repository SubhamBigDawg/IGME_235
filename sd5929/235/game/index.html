    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
    <em>Dig Dug</em> is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to <em>use your shovel to dig your way through the earth</em>. 
    Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called <em>Pooka</em> and <em>Fygar</em>, who will continually chase you around. 
    The only weapon that you carry is an <em>air pump</em>, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. [...]

        This definitely goes under the heading of "Games That Were Made While a Programmer Was on Drugs," or at least had a good imagination. And maybe they were into horror movies too.
